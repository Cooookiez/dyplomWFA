The new algorithm retains the advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method: parallel of algorithm, ease of programming, and ability to incorporate microscopic interactions. A simulation of flow in a two-dimensional symmetric channel with sudden expansion is carried out using the new algorithm on a nonuniform mesh. The results of the simulation are in excellent agreement with previous experimental and numerical results. {\textcopyright} 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method is a simulation technique in computational fluid dynamics. In its standard formulation, it is restricted to regular computation grids, second-order spatial accuracy, and a unity Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number. This paper advances the standard lattice Boltzmann method by introducing a semi-Lagrangian streaming step. The proposed method allows significantly larger time steps, unstructured grids, and higher-order accurate representations of the solution to be used. The appealing properties of the approach are demonstrated in simulations of a two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex, doubly periodic shear layers, and a three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex.},

abstract = {In this paper, a local radial basis function–based semi-Lagrangian lattice Boltzmann method (RBF-SL-LBM) is proposed. This is a mesh-free method that can be used for the simulation of incompressible flows. In this method, the collision step is performed locally, which is the same as in the standard LBM. In the meanwhile, the steaming step is solved in a semi-Lagrangian framework. The distribution functions at the departure points, which may be not the grid points in general, are computed by the local radial basis function interpolation. Several numerical tests are conducted to validate the present method, including the lid-driven cavity flow, the steady and unsteady flow past a circular cylinder, and the flow past an NACA0012 airfoil. The present results are in good agreement with those published in the previous literature, which demonstrates the capability of RBF-SL-LBM for the simulation of incompressible flows.},
